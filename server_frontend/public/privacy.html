    <h1>WaRT Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>WaRT (Warframe Relic Tracker) makes use of Google Sign-in to avoid many of the headaches associated with maintaining our own user/password database.</p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your email address (e.g. attila@gmail.com)</li>
      <li>Your unique Google ID (called “openid”) (e.g. 23895719835795)</li>
      <li>Your basic profile information (full name and profile image)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How do we use the information?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The openid is stored in WaRT’s server database to help with tracking your inventory.</li>
      <li>The email address is stored locally on your computer in the form of an HTTP cookie, to indicate which account you have signed into.</li>
      <li>The remainder of the information is not used or stored.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What information do we share with third parties?</h2>
    <p>Nothing intentionally. While there is always the slim chance that data will be exposed via our negligence or another party’s nefarious intent, we do not intentionally expose your data to any advertising agencies, behavior trackers, or any other third parties.</p>
